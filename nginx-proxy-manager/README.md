- We setup Nginx-Proxy-Manager with Selef Hosted FE and BE
- FE need to be static exported project.
- We put static export files to `./frontend` directory and mount it to the nginx server's `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory to serve.
- to access `nginx-proxy-manager`, we need to allow port `81` for ingress connections.
